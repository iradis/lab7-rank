Hi Im isabelle and I created this document

Creator (Isabelle) 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

kermit<- read_csv("kermit.csv")

kermit_hist<- ggplot(kermit, aes(x=Score.pre))+
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~Gender)

kermit_hist
  

```

Colaborator (Eva): doing some rank-based tests

```{r}
#Is there a significant difference in pre-talk kermit scores for males and females?

#Unpaired: Mann-Whitney U

mwu_kermit <- kermit %>% 
  wilcox.test(Score.pre ~ Gender, data = .)

mwu_kermit

```


Is there a significant differenc in Kermit ranks for pre-talk and post talk scores (ignoring all other variables)?

null 


```{r}
wsr_kermit<- wilcox.test(kermit$Score.pre, kermit$Score.post, paried= TRUE)
wsr_kermit

# there is no significant differece in Kermit rankings before and after his talk (summary....)

```
